## ## Description
Degen Gaming ðŸŽ®, a renowned game studio, has approached you to create a unique token that can reward players and take their game to the next level. You have been tasked with creating a 
token that can be earned by players in their game and then exchanged for rewards in their in-game store. A smart step towards increasing player loyalty and retention ðŸ§ 

To support their ambitious plans, Degen Gaming has selected the Avalanche blockchain, a leading blockchain platform for
web3 gaming projects, to create a fast and low-fee token. With these tokens, players can not only purchase items in the store,
but also trade them with other players, providing endless possibilities for growthðŸ“ˆ


## Functions

1. **Minting New Tokens**: As the contract owner, you have the power to mint new tokens. Simply call the `mint` function and specify the recipient's address and the desired token amount.

2. **Transferring Tokens**: Players can transfer their tokens to others effortlessly using the `transfer` function. Just provide the recipient's address and the token amount to be transferred.

3. **Redeeming Tokens**: Excitingly, players can redeem their tokens for exclusive in-game items from the in-game store. To do this, call the `redeem` function and specify the item to be redeemed. (Additional item redemption logic can be added to the contract.)

4. **Checking Token Balance**: Players can easily check their token balance at any time using the `balanceOf` function. Simply provide your account address to retrieve the balance.

5. **Burning Tokens**: Need to get rid of some tokens? No worries! Anyone can burn their own tokens by calling the `burn` function and specifying the amount to be burned.
